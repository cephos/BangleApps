# App Name

Smarthome-Dashboard that transmits an MQTT-Message with each button-press via a MQTT-Enabled Gadgetbridge-Version. These can be used to call automations via nodered, homassistant or any other mqtt-capable smarthome-systems (all I know of, support MQTT in some way).

## Usage

You have to use the gadgetbridge Version from https://github.com/cephos/Gadgetbridge on your phone to enable MQTT-Calls. Second you need to configure the MQTT-Server, -Port and optional Credentials in the device-settings in Gadgetbridge. 

## Features

Lets you control your Smarthome from your wrist. 

## Controls

In this first prototype Buttons are named with a fixed name after my smarthome needs. They should get customizable in the next release(s).

## Requests

Mention me with @cephos in a github-issue and I try to respond in a weeks time.
